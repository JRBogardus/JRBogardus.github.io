<h1>Article 1-1</h1>
<p>What makes video games so entertaining is that you control the character. In movies, you watch a superhero save the day. In video games, you are the hero that saves the day. You could also be the villain, farmer, builder, or psychotic meth head who just found out his friend he thought died 9 years ago is alive. The thing that makes video games so enticing is the controllable aspect of it.</p>
<h1>Article 1-2</h1>
<p>People like to play video games because of the novelty, the desire to master said game, the exploration, a safe place to fail, and the competitive aspect of certain games.</p>
<h1>Article 1-3</h1>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is one of the best games ever. CNN reviewed the game, and I am looking into the consideration to see what I agree and disagree with. They said that Link’s new abilities are interesting, and I couldn’t agree more. Ultra hand lets you build whatever you want, Fuse enables you to create whatever weapon you want, Ascend lets you easily climb areas, and Rewind lets you reverse time. They also stated that the story is engaging, which it is, and that there are multiple quality-of-life improvements. Overall, this game is impressive.</p>
<h1>Article 1-4</h1>
<p>My dream computer would be a desktop computer. It would have about 8-16 cores so I can edit videos efficiently. I could also play games on it to the maximum resolution. It would have about 64GB of RAM so I can edit videos in 4K. It would also have a ton of storage. Finally, it would have a graphics card.</p>
<h1>Article 1-5</h1>
<p>Toxicity in gaming is when people, usually young males, make fun of someone repeatedly in an online game, which includes sexual harassment, racism, threats of violence, privacy violations, etc. It is important to understand so that we can stop it from spreading. Ways to stop toxicity in gaming can be as simple as saying, “Don’t be toxic,” or you can report them as well.</p> 
<h1>Article 2-1</h1>
<p>One of the new technologies I have been interested in is AI voices. AI voices are when you take someone's voice and make them say whatever you want. The most common ones include Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden playing games such as Minecraft.</p>
